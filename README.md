# Data Analysis: Comparison of Smokers based on their Gender and BMI

## Introduction 

With data provided by the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences located at the National Institutes of Health , male and female smokers and non-smokers were examined in terms of their distribution and compared based on their BMI. Data visualization is utilized in this project to analyze the overall trends and distribution of the smokers, genders, and their BMIs. 

## Data Visualization 

To visualize the data, it was necessary to construct a scatter plot, violin plot, and density plot, to analyze the overall distribution. Below you will find a representation of each figure:
